Based on the interest of the Cultural Board, after having a discussion with the previous 2 General Secretaries I started building a new website for the Cultural Board last month. The website is almost complete and is currently hosted on a free platform pythonanywhere under the Domain: http://cultboardiitg.pythonanywhere.com/home/

![Home Page](https://github.com/rifflord97/cultboardiitg_final/blob/master/homepage.JPG)

It features the Upcoming Events, the Team, pages for Individual clubs featuring their videos, photos, achievements, and the club members and many more features.

Moreover, I plan to include a resources section which would contain tutorials and slides for the viewers to learn various skills that one gets to learn by being a part of the clubs.
